            <p>Lost Signal is a small game in which you embark on a 
               journey as a cute little robot on his first day on the 
               job as a Satellite Repair Robot. You journey out to
               malfunctioning satellites and recievers to fix them in
               an effort to restore the Lost Signal. <br> <br>
               Lost Signal was made for a game jam called Clover Jam 4 hosted
               on itch.io, and is a relatively small game consisting of 
               only 5 levels. The jam lasted for two weeks, and I participated
               with my spare time between going to school and my job. I 
               coded the whole project, as well as making the assets and sound 
               effects, however the music was made by a friend of mine. This
               was the first jam I had ever participated in, and the first
               game that I had ever finished and released.
               All of the code for the game is public on my github page,
               which can be found <a href="https://github.com/zBoca/Lost-Signal">
               here</a>, or you can try it out on itch.io 
               <a href="https://zboca.itch.io/lostsignal">here</a>.</p>

            <p>Shaped by Failure is reversed take on the roguelite genre,
               in which you can continue on after dying at the cost of taking
               a nerf as you rush through 5 different series of Bullet Hell 
               levels. <br> <br>
               Shaped By Failure was made for a game jam called Bullet Hell Jam 5 
               hosted on itch.io. It was a 10 day jam with the theme of "Consequences".
               I joined this game jam between school and work, where I programmed and
               did the art, while two of my friends worked on and live recorded the 
               music. I'm very proud of the product we were able to put out in our time
               limit and I believe the idea was very creative and original, as I didn't see
               any other submissions with similar concepts. The code for this game is public
               on my github page, <a href="https://github.com/zBoca/Shaped-By-Failure">here</a>
               , or you can try it for yourself on itch.io
